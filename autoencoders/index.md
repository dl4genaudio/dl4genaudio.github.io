# Autoencoders

* Autoencoders are neural models that take an input and reconstruct the same input in their output.
    * The reconstruction will not be perfect
    * As a result the autoencoder is "lossy"

* The autoencoder architecture compresses the information in the input to reach a "latent" space.

* Autoencoders are considered to be trained in an unsupervised fashion.

* The latent space (or code, or bottleneck)
    * contains all the information necessary to reconstruct the input.
    * can be considered as a set of features that are not correlated to each other. 

* In contrast, the input may be full of correlated features. 

* Examples autoencoder applications include:
    * data denoising
    * segmentation
    * anomaly detection
    * feature generation


# Homework 10b (due April 8)

* Make all revisions requested by the instructor to your final project proposal.
    
        
# Homework 11a (due April 19)

* Next class we will have a guest speaker
    * [Magdalena Fuentes](https://magdalenafuentes.github.io/) (NYU postdoctoral fellow) will talk to us about her research.
    * She will focus her presentation on these papes: 
        * TBD
        * TBD
    * Read Magdalena's papers in detail
    * On our course subreddit, there is a thread to discuss Magdalena's papers. 
    * You must post two questions you have after reading the paper. 
    * Do not repeat questions that have already been asked.
    * The sooner you post, the less likely it will be that somebody else already asked your question. 
    * You must also try to answer at least one of the questions asked by your peers.
